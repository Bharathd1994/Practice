        <h3>Defintion of article in html5</h3>
        <p> The &lt;article&gt; tag specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site</p>
        <p>The HTML article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.</p>
      </header>
      </article>
      <article id="usage">
        <h3>
          Usage of the article</h3>
        <p>An article element as we know is stand-alone content. If you pick an article out of a Web page, it should make sense all by itself.</p>
        <p>One article element can be nested inside another. For example, if you have a blog post and you want to include a forum post or newspaper article in it, you can nest it in another &lt;article&gt; tag.</p>
      </article>
      <article id="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion of the blog</h3>
        <p> Well, this is a tricky one since i dont have a conclusion for this but it's alright since it is just a practice </p>
